Maybe you're excited to start on your website-building journey, or maybe you're just getting a feel for what Quarto is all about. Regardless, I hope you find these materials helpful. Some notes on what to expect:\n\nThis document is meant to introduce you to Quarto as a tool and framework for building websites, guide you through the process of creating your website (using either RStudio or a command line interface), and deploy it (for free) using GitHub Pages. The content covered here is only an introduction to the wonderful suite of tooling that Quarto provides! I encourage you to also explore [Posit](https://posit.co/)'s incredible [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/), as well as the seemingly endless list of awesome resources created by other Quarto users. Feel free to check out my follow-up workshop materials, [Customizing Quarto Websites using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide) and [Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/talks_workshops/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/).\n\nYou'll encounter some callout boxes throughout these materials, which are meant to provide additional tips, considerations, contexts:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## Note (collapsed by default to minimize scrolling; click to expand)\nThis is a **note**, often providing additional context, clarification, resources, etc.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThis is a **tip**, with suggested workflows, organizational tips, additional tools, etc.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThis is **important text** -- be sure to read these carefully as to not miss any important steps!\n:::\n\n---\nformat: html\n---\n\n## {{< fa circle-question title=\"Question mark\" >}} What is Quarto?\n\n<!-- <img src=\"media/quarto.png\" alt=\"A blue circle divided into four quadrants, followed by the name &apos;quarto&apos;.\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:110px;height:30px;\"/> -->\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a publishing system built on Pandoc that allows users to create dynamic content using R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS (with plans to add more languages too!).\n\nR users have long loved [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for combining prose, code, and outputs into single \"knitted\" documents. Quarto extends all of RMarkdown's best features (plus many more!) to additional languages.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## A side-by-side comparison of `.rmd` vs. `.qmd` files\nIf you're already an avid RMarkdown user, great news! RMarkdown (`.rmd`) and Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files look super similar:\n\n-  document-level metadata and configurations are included in the document's YAML (denoted by the `---` gates at the top of the document)\n-  code is written inside executable code chunks\n-  prose is written in the body of the document\n  \nThere are some slight differences to be aware of:\n\n-  some YAML option names differ between the two document types (e.g. `output` in `.rmd` vs. `format` in `.qmd`)\n-  chunk-level execution options are are written within with code block braces (e.g. ````{r echo=FALSE}`) in `.rmd` files, and written below code block braces following hash pipes, `|#` (e.g. `|# echo: false`) in `.qmd` files\n-  booleans are capitalized in YAML and chunk-level metadata in `.rmd` files (e.g. `FALSE`) and lowercase in `.qmd` files (e.g. `false`)\n- you **Knit** `.rmd` files and **Render** `.qmd` files to convert your work to your desired output type (e.g. `.html`)\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](media/rmd-vs-qmd.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nThey also look pretty similar when knitted/rendered. Below is a side-by-side comparison of a knitted `.rmd` file and a rendered `.qmd` file (both as `.html` files):\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](media/rmd-vs-qmd-output.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](media/quarto_schematic.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n`<svg aria-label=\"Palette\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:#5A5A5A;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><title>Palette</title><path d=\"M512 256c0 .9 0 1.8 0 2.7c-.4 36.5-33.6 61.3-70.1 61.3H344c-26.5 0-48 21.5-48 48c0 3.4 .4 6.7 1 9.9c2.1 10.2 6.5 20 10.8 29.9c6.1 13.8 12.1 27.5 12.1 42c0 31.8-21.6 60.7-53.4 62c-3.5 .1-7 .2-10.6 .2C114.6 512 0 397.4 0 256S114.6 0 256 0S512 114.6 512 256zM128 288a32 32 0 1 0 -64 0 32 32 0 1 0 64 0zm0-96a32 32 0 1 0 0-64 32 32 0 1 0 0 64zM288 96a32 32 0 1 0 -64 0 32 32 0 1 0 64 0zm96 96a32 32 0 1 0 0-64 32 32 0 1 0 0 64z\"/></svg>`{=html} Art by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).
